# Snapshots
Each part that comes with some code. If there is anything specific for a given stage, I will provide a tag for it.

# Requirements
The project requires you to have:
* docker
* docker-compose
* make
* python3 (or maybe not)

Maybe some more, but rather not.

I am assuming you know something, but not much should be required. I haven't made many tutorials before so it may require some improvement.

You are required to ask questions. **THE DUMBEST QUESTIONS ARE THOSE NOT ASKED**

# /etc/hosts
It's easier to work with hostnames. Here'se what you can add to your hosts file
```
10.5.0.10 gitlab
```
